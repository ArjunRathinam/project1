<b><hr color = "red" size = "+7">Major Dhyan Chand, the Indian Hockey legend is well-known for the goal-scoring ability that made him earn three gold medals at three consecutive Olympic events, creating history. The iconic personality has served both in Army as well as at the hockey field throughout his life. Widely considered as the magician of hockey, the man had scored around 1000 goals in his active career which is a record feat.

 

Dhyan Chand was born on 29th August 1905, in the city of "Sangam"- Allahabad to a British Indian Army employee Sameshwar Dutt Singh and Sharadha Singh. Due to his father’s frequent official transfers, he was not able to keep pace with the academics and had to drop down studies after schooling for just six years. The boy was initially interested in wrestling, but after joining the Indian Army at the age of 16 got more inclined towards field hockey. He used to undergo Army training during the daytime and practised hockey in the moonlight.</hr>

In 1956 he retired from the army with the rank of major. His son, Ashok Kumar Singh, was a member of India’s Olympic field hockey teams in the 1970s and scored the winning goal in the 1975 World Cup championship.</b>
